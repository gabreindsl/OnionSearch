**OnionSearch** is a search engine focused on the **deep web**, more specifically on websites accessible through the **Tor network (.onion)**. Unlike the negative image often associated with the darknet, OnionSearch was created with the goal of **organizing and promoting legitimate and useful content** from this environment.

It works as a **catalog of categorized links**, bringing together websites related to **privacy, freedom of expression, independent journalism, discussion forums, digital libraries, academic projects, secure communication services**, and activist initiatives. In this way, it helps users find reliable information without having to blindly navigate the Tor network.

In short, OnionSearch aims to **highlight the positive side of the darknet**, emphasizing its role as a space for resistance to censorship, protection of personal data, and free access to information, rather than associating it solely with illegal activities.
